# Deep-Learning-Project

- In this project, we aim to apply neural network algorithms such as artificial neural networks and convolutional neural networks to solve the famous problem of identifying digits in images.

- This project comprises of two parts, first on ANNs and second on CNNs
- Two notebooks are shared
- The focus of most of the questions is to apply algorithms, write observations, and extract insights.
